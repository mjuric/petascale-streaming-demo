# Beyond VOEvent 2.0: Alert streaming in GB/s Era
2019-11-8, Petabytes to Science: Data Inclusion Revolution, Boston, MA

A hands-on demo of the Kafka streaming platform used for the ZTF and LSST,
and a candidate for the next-generation system for distribution of
multi-messenger alerts (LIGO and IceCube).

This demo will teach you about:
 * Architecture of streaming in GB/sec era
 * What astronomical event alerts look like
 * Receiving and acting on astronomical alerts in the era of LSST

We will show:
* How to implement an alert filter, forwarding only alerts of interest
* How to execute filters in a remote notebook environmentDemo the
  reliability of the system by terminating various components and verifying
  all alerts are eventually delivered
* Demo the scalability of the system under numerous simultaneous connections (i.e., have everyone connect and stream at
the same time).

Prerequisites:
 * GitHub account
 * Web browser
